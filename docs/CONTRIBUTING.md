# Contributing to Development of this tool
The general flow of the app is:

1. parse args & read in the spec using `elm-pages`
2. generate the Elm code with `elm-codegen`
3. write it to disk using `elm-pages`.


## Getting Started
Make sure you have Nix installed (with flakes enabled) so you can use the
project's development shell. An easy way to satisfy this requirement is the
[Determinate Nix Installer][determinate-nix].

- Clone this repo
- Inside your cloned repo, run `direnv allow` to automatically enter the development shell,
  - if you don't use direnv, run `nix develop` to manually enter a development shell
- Start coding!
- Run `npm run test:gen` to test the file generation, and `npm run test:watch` to run `elm-test` in watch mode

## A note on the modules in `codegen/Gen`
These modules are generated by `elm-codegen install`, and then trimmed using `elm-review` to remove the unused modules and files.

Therefore, you can use `elm-codegen install` to generate a binding that's missing, and `elm-review` before committing to only add what is needed.
